# Custom Logo Instructions

To add your custom logo to the Extreme Weather Predictions app:

1. Place your logo image file in this directory (`static/images/`)
2. Name the file `logo.png` (recommended size: at least 192x192 pixels)
3. The logo will automatically appear on all pages of the application

## Requirements

- PNG format recommended
- Square aspect ratio (1:1) works best
- Transparent background preferred
- Minimum size: 192x192 pixels (larger is better for high-DPI displays)
